🧠 How It Works
The program starts by asking for your name and age.
If you're at least 16, you can select your preferred language.
You’ll then be presented with a series of multiple-choice questions.
Each question has a 30-second time limit.
Your answers are evaluated immediately with feedback.
A final score and result (PASS/FAIL) are displayed at the end.


✨ Sample Questions
"What does a red traffic light mean?"
"Minimum tread depth on a tire?"
"Flashing amber at a crossing means?"


Each question is displayed with four answer choices (A–D), and you must type the correct letter to answer.

Good Luck.
